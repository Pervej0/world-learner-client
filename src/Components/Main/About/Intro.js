          The first thing that strikes in our minds when we think about
          education is gaining knowledge. Education is a tool which provides
          people with knowledge, skill, technique, information, enables them to
          know their rights and duties toward their family, society as well as
          the nation. It expands vision and outlook to see the world. It
          develops the capabilities to fight against injustice, violence,
          corruption and many other bad elements in the society.
          <br />
          <br />
          Education gives us knowledge of the world around us. It develops in us
          a perspective of looking at life. It is the most important element in
          the evolution of the nation. Without education, one will not explore
          new ideas. It means one will not able to develop the world because
          without ideas there is no creativity and without creativity, there is
          no development of the nation.

          A good education doesnâ€™t simply mean going to school or college &
          getting a degree. Trade & commerce of the country will also be
          flourished easily if its citizens are well-educated. Education helps
          to become self-dependent and build great confidence among them to
          accomplish difficult tasks. On getting an education, their standard of
          life gets improved.
          <br />
          <br />
          Education is the most important ingredient to change the world. Due to
          lack of education, many illiterate people suffer the hardships of
          discrimination, untouchability & injustices prevailing in the society
          but with the advancement of a good education. If all the people will
          be educated; this ultimately leads to the upliftment of economically
          weaker sections of society.
